## Assignment 2
Aim of [Assignment 2](https://github.com/sersavn/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/blob/master/Course1/Assignment%2B2.ipynb) is to learn basic operations
of the pandas such as: 
- picking elements with iloc, loc, ix 
- sorting values
- creating columns and rows
- calculating sum,min,max by row/axis
- group series using mapper via groupby
- dropping column/rows

## Assignment 3

In addition to Assignment 2 following commands was applied:
- mean
- sum 
- std 
- size

## Assignment 4
Aim of the [Assignment 4](https://github.com/sersavn/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/blob/master/Course1/Assignment%2B4.ipynb) is to check hypothesis that land in the US cities with universities less prone to lower prices during the mortgage crisis.
Hypothesis was checked by calculation of the T-test for the means of two independent samples of scores by scipy ttest ind.
T-test value for given sample was 1.345e-06, which completely confirms the hypothesis.
